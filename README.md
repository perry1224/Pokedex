# Pokedex

## Objective
To showcase a simple App that can fetch data from a public API in the form of a list. Then upon click, to fetch and display details of individual items.

## Reflections on this project:
This is the first big project where I have taken everything I have learned about JavaScript, Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS and applied my knowledge to create my first ever Pokedex. It was a real challenge. For example, I barely understood what JSON does and how it is utilized or what exactly an API is. One important lesson I learned is the advantages of an API. Using the pokemon API readily available allowed me to easily list all 150 pokemon and their details without having to manually enter it in. If I had to go back again to redo this assignment I would definitely do my own small projects first before hoping onto the Pokedex to give myself an easier time.

## Technologies
